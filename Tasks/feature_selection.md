## Short Note on Feature Selection Techniques:

Feature selection is an important step in machine learning which is basically identifying or selecting the most relevant features from the dataset to improve modelâ€™s efficiency.

In many real-world scenarios, datasets may contain numerous features, but not all of them contribute equally to the model's predictive performance. Feature selection helps us identify the most important and discard the redundant feature which in turn improves the models performance.

Types of Feature Selection Techniques:
- **Filter Methods**: These methods assess the statistical properties of features independently of the chosen model using statistical tests, correlation analysis and select features based on their individual relevance.

- **Wrapper Methods**: Wrapper methods evaluate feature subsets by training and testing the model on different combinations of features which involves  computationally intensive techniques like recursive feature elimination or forward/backward selection.

- **Embedded Methods**: Embedded methods perform feature selection during the model training process itself. The model automatically determines feature importance by incorporating feature selection as part of its learning algorithm.


Feature selection is an iterative process that involves multiple iterations of model training, feature evaluation, and refinement. It may require experimentation with different techniques and evaluation metrics to find the optimal feature subset for our specific problem.
