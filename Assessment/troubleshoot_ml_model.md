## Troubleshoot a machine learning model
			
One can follow the below given process to troubleshoot the ML model.
Start with identifying the problem that is basically causing the issue. We can check a specific metric which is not performing well with the current model's architecture. Then we can proceed with the following points

Analyzing the Input data: Missing values, outliers and skewed distributions can affect the performance of the model. Preprocessing the data, applying transformation and feature scaling can help in such cases.

- **Evaluate models**: on various metrics instead of using only one metric.

- **Feature Engineering and selection**: Feature selection techniques like backward elimination or recursive feature elimination can help identify the most informative features. Check if some of the features can be modified to get better results.

- **Model Complexity**: Check if the model is too complex(overfitting) or too simple(underfitting). Adjusting the model's complexity by modifying the architecture, adding regularization techniques, or adjusting hyperparameters to achieve an optimal score.

- **Tuning Hyperparameters**: ​​Use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to explore the hyperparameter space and choose the best one.

- **Adding more data for training**: Collecting more labeled data for training improve the performance.

- **Use Ensemble techniques**: Techniques like bagging, boosting, or stacking can help mitigate individual model weaknesses and improve predictive accuracy.

- **Cross Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques such as k-fold or stratified cross-validation to assess the model's performance across multiple data subsets of the same data.

- **Seek expert advice or domain experts**: Consulting with domain experts, data scientists, or machine learning practitioners. They may offer valuable insights, alternative approaches, or domain-specific knowledge that can help address the challenges we are facing.

The whole process is iterative, we have to keep checking all these things again and again to obtain the desired performance.
